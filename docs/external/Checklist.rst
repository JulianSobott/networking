New project checklist
======================

This page contains a checklist with all necessary parts that you need, when you start a new project. This checklist \
assumes you know how to use the library and just need a short recapitulation. If not check out the :any:`Getting_started` \
page.

1. Install networking ( :ref:`Installation` )
2. Overwrite classes:
    2.1 ServerFunctions (:any:`Functions`)

    2.2 ClientFunctions (:any:`Functions`)

    2.3 ServerCommunicator ()

    2.4 ClientCommunicator ()

3. Start the server with :class:`ClientManager`
4. Start the client with created :class:`ServerCommunicator`

While you are working on your project, remember to add necessary functions to the :any:`Functions`.
