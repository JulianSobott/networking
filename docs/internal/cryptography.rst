Cryptography
==============

The pynetworking provides a mechanism to encrypt messages, that are send. Every
:class:`Communicator <pynetworking.Communication_general.Communicator>` has its own
:class:`Cryptographer <pynetworking.Cryptography.Cryptographer>`. The cryptographer encrypts outgoing messages and
decrypts incoming
messages.
