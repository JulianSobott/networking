Cryptography
==============

The networking provides a mechanism to encrypt messages, that are send. Every
:class:`Communicator <networking.Communication_general.Communicator>` has its own
:class:`Cryptographer <networking.Cryptography.Cryptographer>`. The cryptographer encrypts outgoing messages and
decrypts incoming
messages.
